# Shahu-Causal-Origin-Principle-SCOP-
Universes don’t start from nothing — they come from each other.  In SCOP:  Universe A ends, and its collapse creates Universe B.  Universe B ends, and its collapse creates Universe A again.  This forms an endless loop — no beginning, no end.  🧘‍♂️  “Each universe is the mirror birth of the other.”
